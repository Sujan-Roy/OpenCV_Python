Image transformation is the process of altering an image in some way to obtain a new representation of the same image. 
In computer vision, image transformation techniques are used to enhance, manipulate, or extract useful information from images.

There are various types of image transformations that can be performed in computer vision, including:

1. Scaling: Scaling refers to changing the size of an image. It can be done using various techniques like nearest-neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation, bicubic interpolation, etc.

2. Rotation: Rotation refers to rotating an image by a certain angle. It can be done using techniques like affine transformation or homography.

3. Translation: Translation refers to shifting an image in a particular direction. It can be done using techniques like affine transformation.

4. Flipping: Flipping refers to flipping an image horizontally or vertically. It can be done using simple matrix operations.

5. Cropping: Cropping refers to selecting a specific portion of an image. It can be done using simple matrix operations.

6. Warping: Warping refers to transforming an image such that it takes a new shape. It can be done using techniques like perspective transformation or homography.

7. Color transformation: Color transformation refers to changing the color scheme of an image. It can be done using techniques like histogram equalization, color space conversion, etc.

These techniques are used in various computer vision applications like object detection, face recognition, image segmentation, etc.
