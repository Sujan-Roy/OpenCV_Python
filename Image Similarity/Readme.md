# what is Image similarity
Image similarity in computer vision refers to the process of measuring the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between two or more images. This is an important task in many applications of computer vision, such as image retrieval, object recognition, and face recognition.

# Type of Image similarity
There are various techniques for measuring image similarity, including:

Pixel-based similarity: This method compares the similarity of individual pixels in two images. It is a simple and fast method, but it may not be very effective in cases where images differ significantly in terms of lighting, color, or texture.

Feature-based similarity: This method extracts certain features from the images, such as edges, corners, or color histograms, and then compares these features. Feature-based similarity is more effective than pixel-based similarity since it is more robust to variations in lighting and color.

Deep learning-based similarity: This method uses deep neural networks to extract features from images and measure their similarity. Deep learning-based similarity has become very popular in recent years due to its high accuracy and ability to handle complex and large-scale datasets.
